After twelve years in online market research, continuously working on improving my soft skills, analysing data, managing research projects and leading teams, I have decided to step into the fascinating world of tech so I have joined Makers.

I have always been passionate about math and science and have enjoyed exploring how things work. I also like building things myself, continuously learn and be in touch with what's new. I thrive in environments which focus on team work, growth, challenging the status quo and improving people's lifes.

## Skills

#### Tech Skills : Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL

#### Communication

This has been at the core of my job both as a project manager and as a team lead. Being able to listen and understand, clearly deliver messages and adjust these to my audience have always been key. Whether it was coaching new PMs on their client services skills, liaising with upper management or discussing project specifications with the programming team, I've had to wear different hats and make sure all stakeholders' needs are met. This has led to repeat business with clients being delighted by the service provided but also to a healthy team morale and an atmosphere of support and collaboration in the teams I've managed.

#### Problem solving

I strongly believe that we're there is a will, there is a way. I stay focused on the challenge, come up with different action plans, evaluate the pros and cons and use a quick feedback loop to get to the solution that best addresses the issues at hand. The years spent in management have exposed me to several situations where I had to support my team in getting the best outcome, both for the client and the company, when problems arose.

#### Dual perspective

As a project manager, I worked closely with technical teams so had to find the balance between staying on budget and being on time, whilst at the same time understanding my colleagues' point of view, the complexity of the technical challenges they faced and being able to translate that back to the client and negociate on specifications.

#### Fast, independent learner

I've always taken initiative of my own development. I've had to be very resourceful in the positions I've held, since it was my job to make things happen when dealing with non standard situations (projects gone wrong, delayed etc). Throughout my journey in coding I have attended Codebar and Makers events, completed online courses, read documentation, bounced ideas off other developers and put everything together to help me solve the problems that I faced during the learning process.
