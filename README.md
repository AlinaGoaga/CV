Junior full-stack developer with twelve years experience in online research, embarking on a new adventure into the tech wold. 
I combine a strong background in communication and project management, with technical skills and a passion for technology to create code that is clean, efficient and easily maintainable. 

In my previous role, I have successfully managed teams and looked after some of the company's biggest accounts, from market research agencies to consultancies and corporate clients. This has given me exposure to the wider business context, which I am combining with the solid development fundamentals gained at Makers to become a better developer.

## Skills

#### Fast, independent learner

I am a quick, logical and systematic learner, and my technical skill set has been growing exponentially since joining Makers. During the first 8 weeks at Makers Academy, I was able to strengthen my Ruby and JavaScript programming abilities to the point where in week 9 I felt comfortable creating a Facebook clone with React as frontend using a Rails API for the backend. I've been exposed to multiple tools from testing frameworks like Rspec and Jasmine to continuous integration with Travis CI and deployment to production on Heroku. Every week we've been exposed to new challenges whether it was building my own testing framework or trying to create a single page app whilst having no prior knowledge of JavaScript. Throughout these I have continued to be resourceful and deliver on the requirements whilst striving to follow SOLID principles.

#### Communication

This has been at the core of my job both as a project manager and as a team lead. Being able to listen and understand, clearly deliver messages and adjust these to my audience have always been key. Whether it was coaching new PMs on their client services skills, liaising with upper management or discussing project specifications with the programming team, I've had to wear different hats and make sure all stakeholders' needs are met. This has led to repeat business with clients being delighted by the service provided but also to a healthy team morale and an atmosphere of support and collaboration in the teams I've managed.

#### Problem solving

I strongly believe that we're there is a will, there is a way. I stay focused on the challenge, come up with different action plans, evaluate the pros and cons and use a quick feedback loop to get to the solution that best addresses the issues at hand. The years spent in management have exposed me to a large variety of situations where I had to support my team in getting the best outcome, both for the client and the company, when problems arose. 

#### Dual perspective

As a project manager, I worked closely with technical teams so had to find the balance between staying on budget and being on time, whilst at the same time understanding the complexity of the technical challenges scripting teams faced and being able to translate that back to the client and negotiate on specifications.
